**Forgotten Fortress** — A 2D Language-Decoding Puzzle Adventure

A mystery-driven 2D puzzle game about deciphering a lost culture’s language through observation, inference, and environmental clues.

🎮 Overview

This game is a narrative puzzle experience where the player gradually uncovers the meaning of an ancient symbolic language.
You explore hand-crafted environments, interact with inscriptions, and update a dynamic Journal System that tracks every discovered glyph and meaning guess.

The goal is to interpret the symbols well enough to unlock new areas, understand the culture that built them, and ultimately reveal the truth behind their forgotten civilization.

Use context clues to infer their meaning

Combine previously learned glyphs with new information to solve puzzles

📖 Dynamic Player Journal

Automatically updates with newly discovered symbols

Displays guesses, confirmed meanings, and discovered connections

Implemented through multiple interconnected MonoBehaviour scripts calling each other to update pages, reveal snippets, and animate transitions
